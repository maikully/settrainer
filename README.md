# Set Trainer


Set trainer is a website to help beginners practice the card game Set.

App link: https://maikully.github.io/settrainer/

The website shows the user two cards and gives them five options. To progress, the user selects the card that completes a set with the first two.
Practice matching sets in Practice Mode, or match as many sets as you can in 1 minute with lockouts and ramping difficulty in 1-Blitz!
